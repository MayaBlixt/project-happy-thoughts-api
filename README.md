# Project Happy Thoughts API

This project's main goal is to learn POST requests, using endpoints created by me such as allowing to POST data to my API and then save the data to my Mongo Database.

For this I used and updated the "Happy Thoughts" Frontend created in an earlier project (Happy thoughts - Week 11).
